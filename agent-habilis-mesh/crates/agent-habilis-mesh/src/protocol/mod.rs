//! Wire types and seed-derived identities — the vocabulary every consumer
//! speaks.
//!
//! **Flat by design.** The implementation is split across submodules (message
//! envelope, `💬…` identifier, nickname, crypto, sealing, address codec), but
//! they are crate-private and everything lands here: a consumer that needed a
//! `Message` and a `MeshName` and a `Password` used to write three import paths
//! into the engine's file layout, which then could not be rearranged without
//! churning every one of them.
