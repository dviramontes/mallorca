/*
 * mesh.h — the C ABI of the agent-habilis-mesh engine.
 *
 * Hand-written, and the counterpart of `src/ffi.rs`: change one, change the
 * other. `tests/ffi_smoke.rs` exercises the same entry points from Rust, and
 * `examples/mesh-pipe-c` compiles against this file, so a mismatch fails a test
 * rather than corrupting a caller's stack.
 *
 * Link against the cdylib the crate builds:
 *
 *     cargo build -p agent-habilis-mesh-ffi
 *     cc prog.c -I<repo>/crates/agent-habilis-mesh-ffi/include \
 *        -L<repo>/target/debug -lagent_habilis_mesh_ffi
 *
 * Conventions
 * -----------
 * - A pointer-returning call yields NULL on failure; an `int` call returns 0 on
 *   success and -1 on failure. `mesh_last_error()` then holds the reason.
 * - Every call is blocking and thread-confined: one handle belongs to one
 *   thread. Distinct handles are independent (a single process may hold several,
 *   each with its own runtime and endpoint).
 * - A handle from mesh_open() must be released with mesh_close().
